<p>The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are a fever, coughing, and breathing problems. Unless you have severe symptoms, you can most likely treat them at home, the way you would for a cold or the flu. Most people recover from COVID-19 without the need for hospital care. Call your doctor to ask about whether you should stay home or get medical care in person.

Scientists are trying to make new medicines and test some existing drugs to see whether they can treat COVID-19. In the meantime, there are a number of things that can relieve symptoms, both at home and at the hospital.

<li>Rest. It can make you feel better and may speed your recovery.</li>
<li>Stay home. Don't go to work, school, or public places.</li>
<li>Drink fluids. You lose more water when you're sick. Dehydration can make symptoms worse and cause other health problems.</li>
<li>Monitor. If your symptoms get worse, call your doctor right away. Don't go to their office without calling first. They might tell you to stay home, or they may need to take extra steps to protect staff and other patients.</li>
<li>Ask your doctor about over-the-counter medicines that may help, like acetaminophen to lower your fever.</li>
